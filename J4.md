## 1. Consider the class declaration below:
```
// Is this possible?
public class Lion extends Mammal, Carnivore {
    // ...
}
```
- Explain why the following class declaration is not possible in Java.
- What are the limitations of the ```extends``` key word?
- How can you accomplish this inheritance structure task in Java?

The following class declaration is not possible in Java because you cannot inherit from multiple classes in Java, because Java uses a single inheritance model. When using the ```extends``` key word the limitation is that you can only list one class following the ```extends``` statement. You could acomplish this inheritance statement by defining Carnivore as an interface and Mammal as a class. Therefore, Lion can extend Mammal and implement Carnivore. This would look like this:
```
public class Lion extends Mammal implements Carnivore{
 //...
}
```
For reference, an interface in java is "a specification of methods that must be defined when a class implements the interface. It is essentailly a way to guarantee certain functionality in the class that realizes the implementation". 

## 2. What are some of the functional differences between an abstract class and an interface? Use the example below to answer this question.
```
public abstract class Employee {
    // ...
}

// vs.

public interface Employee {
    //...
}
```
Interfaces cannot have fields or constructors, whereas abstract classes can. A class can also implement multiple interfaces, wherare a class could only extend a single abstract class. This is largely due to the idea that Java does not do multiple inheritances. In relation to the example, for interface employee, the only thing you can do is provide method signatures without any implementation. Abstract classes can include both the signatures and implementations. 

## 3. Consider the interfaces for a Stack and Queue of ints.
```
public interface Stack {
   public void push(int v);
   public int pop();
   public int peek();
}

public interface Queue {
   public void enqueue(int v);
   public int dequeue();
   public int peek();
}
```
Now suppose you had a ```LinkedList``` implementation to store ```ints``` with the following methods defined. Using those methods in LinkedList complete the realization of a Stack and Queue:

```
public class LinkedList implements Stack, Queue {
  public LinkedList() {/*...*/}
  public void addToFront(int v) {/*...*/}
  public int rmFromFront() {/*...*/}
  public void addToBack(int v) {/*...*/}
  public void rmFromBack() {/*...*/}
  
  public void push (int v){
    addtoFront(v); 
  }
  public int pop(){
    return rmFromFront();
  }
  public int peek(){
    int front = rmFromFront();
    addToFront(front);
    return front;
  }

  public void enqueue (int v){
    addToFront(v);
  }

  public void dequeue(){
    rmFromBack();
  }
  
}
```

## 4. Rewrite the Stack and Queue interfaces from above to be generic, as well as the LinkedList. Explain how this is now generic to manage collections of any class.
```
public abstract class Employee {
    // ...
}

// vs.

public interface Employee {
    //...
}
```

```

public interface Stack {
   public void push(T v);
   public T pop();
   public T peek();
}

public interface Queue {
   public void enqueue(T v);
   public T dequeue();
   public T peek();
}
```

```

public class LinkedList implements Stack, Queue {
  public LinkedList() {/*...*/}
  public void addToFront(T v) {/*...*/}
  public T rmFromFront() {/*...*/}
  public void addToBack(T v) {/*...*/}
  public void rmFromBack() {/*...*/}
  
  public void push (T v){
    addtoFront(v); 
  }
  public T pop(){
    return rmFromFront();
  }
  public T peek(){
    T front = rmFromFront();
    addToFront(front);
    return front;
  }

  public void enqueue (T v){
    addToFront(v);
  }

  public void dequeue(){
    rmFromBack();
  }

```


## 5. The code below does not use Java generics. Update it to do so. Notably, there should not need casting, but no, the solution isn’t just removing the (String) casting before the .get method. 
```
import java.util.HashMap;

public class TestHashMap {

    public static void main (String[] argv) {
        // Create a new hashmap.
        HashMap<String,String> fabFour = new HashMap<String,String>();

        // Insert four key and value pairs.
        fabFour.put("John", "John Lennon");
        fabFour.put("Paul", "Paul McCartney");
        fabFour.put("George", "George Harrison");
        fabFour.put("Ringo", "Ringo Star");

        // Use a key to retrieve a value.
        String fullName = fabFour.get("Ringo");

        // Prints "Ringo Star"
        System.out.println(fullName);
    }
}
```

## 6. What is “Erasure” with java generics?
"Erasure" is where the generic type annotation is erased and replaced with Object with the appropriate casting after compilation.

For the code below, what does the code “erase” to?

```
public static void main(final String args[]) {
        Shelf<String> favorite_words = shelfBuilder();
        favorite_words.addItem("Zoetrope");
        favorite_words.addItem("Succinct");
        //...        
        String s = favorite_words.getItem(1);
        System.out.println(s);
    }
```
The code "erase" removes the generic type argument and uses Object instead. Here, erasure would remove the Shelf<String> part of the code and simply use Shelf. addItem and getItem would include Object instead of the generic type annotation and then the final output would be casted to a String. 

## 7. Finish the main method in the TestShelf class above.
```
public class TestShelf {
    public static void main(final String args[]) {
        Shelf<String> characterNames = new Shelf<String>("Shakespeare Character Names");
        characterNames.addItem("Hamlet");
        characterNames.addItem("Othello");
        characterNames.addItem("Cordelia");
        characterNames.addItem("Juliet");
        characterNames.printShelf();


        Shelf<Integers> famousIntegers = new Shelf<Integer>("Famous Integers");
        famousIntegers.addItem(new Integer(13));
        famousIntegers.addItem(new Integer(23));
        famousIntegers.addItem(new Intgeger(42));
        famousIntegers.addItem(new Integer(1729));
        famousIntegers.printShelf();
    }
}
```
NOTE: *generics: you're only putting in the objects/types you declare.

## 8. Consider the following code snippets for a LinkedList you may implement and a main method. Explain why the line with MARK is extremely inefficient? Use Big-O to explain.
The line with Mark is extremely inefficient becauase, by calling get(i) in such a large for loop, the LinkedList ll must traverse all the way to the i-th node each iteration to find the node, which is just incredibly slow. 

## 9. Continuing with the example above, explain why expanding ``` LinkedList ``` to implement ```Iterable``` solves the inefficiency problem you described above.
Expanding Linkedlist solves the inefficency problem because it makes the traversal of ll a lot quicker than what it was prior. Expanding to include an Iterable interface allows for the elements in the class to be iterated, meaning that the incredibly inefficent traversal described in question 8 does not occur anymore. 

## 10. Explain why the ```Comparable``` interface is an interface rather than class?
The Comparable interface is an interface instead of a class becuase it can be more flexible this way. Since Java is a single inheritance model, having Comparable as an interface makes it so that interface can be implement in several classes, thus allowing for it ot be utilizes by many different classes. 

## 11. Add the ```compareTo``` method in the ```Car``` class above. So that the main method will print out:
```
Name: Lamborghini Top Speed: 225
Name: Porsche Top Speed: 202
Name: Mustang Top Speed: 144
Name: Jeep Top Speed: 110
```

```
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Car implements Comparable<Car> {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Car> carsList = new ArrayList<>();
        carsList.add(new Car("Porsche", 202));
        carsList.add(new Car("Jeep", 110));
        carsList.add(new Car("Mustang", 144));
        carsList.add(new Car("Lamborghini", 225));

        Collections.sort(carsList);
        for(Car car : carsList) {
            System.out.println("Name: " + car.getName() + " Top Speed: " + car.getTopSpeed());
        }
    }
    private String name;
    private Integer topSpeed;

    public Car(String name, Integer topSpeed) {
        this.name = name;
        this.topSpeed = topSpeed;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Integer getTopSpeed() {
        return topSpeed;
    }

    // TODO: Complete the Car class by adding the compareTo method
    //       needed to correctly implement Comparable<Car>.

//@Override
    public int compareTo(Car comparison ){
        return comparison.getTopSpeed().compareTo(this.topSpeed);
}
```
